# Simple CRUD with ReactJS

I built it to study ReactJS combined with http requests using axios. To simulate a REST API, was made a simple project using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Thanks to [Leonardo Leit√£o](https://github.com/leonardomleitao), I watched some of his videos about web develop and he used this project to teach about React.
